Final Project for CMSC 208Speech Synthesis and Recognition

A binary language model based on all the Harry Potter books. It will then create sentences based on that model and assess the probability of a sentence being from the HP series.

Choose a text corpus and implement a bigram language model. Assess the success of your model by using it to generate example sentences. Then implement at least one method of addressing data sparsity and see if it improves the quality of the model.

Note from Jane:
You can check the Jurafsky and Martin textbook chapter on n-gram models for smoothing methods to address data sparsity. 

You can also implement sentence generation and test the quality of your model by asking a set of evaluators to distinguish between real sentences from your corpus and those generated by your model. The less successful they are at this task the better your model is.

Extra options to be included:
1) Include sentence boundaries in your model. This will involve modifying the preprocessing function as well as the bigram_model function. Also be sure to use the sentence boundary probabilities in your get_sentence_probability function.

2) Implement a function that uses the model to generate a sentence.
